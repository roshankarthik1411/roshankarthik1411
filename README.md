# Hi, I’m Roshan 👋

## AI-Focused Software Engineer | Builder of Practical AI Systems | Problem-First Thinker

I’m a graduate software engineer with a strong focus on **AI-powered systems and real-world problem solving**.  
Instead of building projects just to showcase tools, I focus on **solving actual problems** using clean, structured, and scalable approaches.

My work reflects how modern engineering teams think:  
**understand the problem → design a system → implement cleanly → evaluate → document clearly**.

---

## 🧭 My Engineering Philosophy

I believe strong engineers are defined less by buzzwords and more by:
- How they **break down problems**
- How they **structure systems**
- How they **communicate decisions**
- How they **learn and iterate**

That’s why every project here is:
- Problem-driven (not tutorial-driven)
- Modular and readable
- Documented for humans
- Built with evaluation and improvement in mind

## 🚀 What Makes My GitHub Profile Stand Out

Most GitHub profiles contain:
- Incomplete demos  
- Shallow projects  
- Minimal documentation  

My profile is intentionally different:
- ✅ Real-world use cases (security, automation, analysis)
- ✅ Multiple AI assistants across domains
- ✅ Evaluation pipelines (not just outputs)
- ✅ Secure config handling (`.env.example`, `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Clear, recruiter-readable READMEs

This profile represents **how I think**, not just what I code.

## 🛡️ Flagship Project — ScamGuard AI

**ScamGuard AI** is an AI-powered scam detection system designed to analyze messages, emails, and online content to identify phishing and fraud attempts.

### Why this project matters
- Scam messages are a major cybersecurity risk
- Users struggle to identify fraud confidently
- False positives and unclear warnings reduce trust

### What I implemented
- AI-based classification: *Scam / Not Scam / Uncertain*
- Dataset-driven testing and evaluation
- Modular pipeline architecture
- Structured outputs using schemas
- Testing and evaluation scripts for validation

This project reflects my interest in **AI systems that protect users**, not just generate text.
